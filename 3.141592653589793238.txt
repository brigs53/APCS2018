I honestly don't know what's up with all the hate for Ajit Pai. Personally, I think what's he's doing is great! Net Neutrality (Free Internet) has to go!!! Honestly who's idea was it to give free internet? All it does is bring 0 order and only chaos. We need a stricter internet and making a plan with a service provider to buy things like either video or social media is an amazing idea. It finally brings order. I am SO SO SO SO hoping on (I believe) December 24th that the FCC votes to finally KILL net Neutrality and bring back order! #WeSupportYouPai #GoPai #KillNetNeutrality ??
